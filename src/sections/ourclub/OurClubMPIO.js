    Complaints Manager: Michele Verwey <a href="mailto:complaints@southcurlcurlslsc.com.au">complaints@southcurlcurlslsc.com.au</a>

    text: `<p >
    An MPIO is available to provide information to members who may have an issue or grievance at the club. The MPIO may be a first point of contact for any member wishing to raise a concern. To contact the MPIO, please email Dave Alldis <a href="mailto:MPIO@southcurlcurlslsc.com.au">MPIO@southcurlcurlslsc.com.au</a> to arrange a call back. After contacting the MPIO, should a member wish to proceed with a formal complaint, this can be lodged via the online complaints portal: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://complaints.sls.com.au/"> https://complaints.sls.com.au/</a>
</p>
<p >
    All formal complaints are handled by a Complaints Manager, who will take action to resolve complaints after they are lodged via the portal. We understand that in a community organisation where everyone knows each other, conflicts of interest can arise. We want members to feel they are able to raise any concerns they have, and if there is a conflict of interest and members would prefer to speak to someone else within the club regarding their concern, please email <a href="mailto:president@southcurlcurlslsc.com.au">president@southcurlcurlslsc.com.au</a></i>. Alternatively, you can contact the MPIO at your branch or any SLS MPIO.
